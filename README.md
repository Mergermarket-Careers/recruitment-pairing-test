# recruitment-pairing-test

Starting point for the recruitment pairing test

## What is this?

This exercise is designed to see how you think about problems and go about solving them in a work environment. Treat this as a task in your normal working day. Feel free to use search engines, MDN, stackoverflow etc., ask questions and discuss ideas with the others in the room.

There is no pressure to finish the whole exercise, but we do expect to see some code written for us to assess.

## What we're looking for

- Clean, maintainable code
- Backed by tests
- Pragmatism - i.e. no over-engineering

## Getting started

Clone this repo.

Use nvm to ensure your node version is OK: `nvm install && nvm use`

Then pull dependencies: `npm install`

Run the tests:

`npm test`

Run the application:

`npm start`

It should be on http://localhost:9090

## Now what?

Read [the user story](user-story-1.md), ask any questions, start pairing!
